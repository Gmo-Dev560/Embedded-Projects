**Microcontroller:** ATmega328PB  
**Programming Language:** C++ 
**Tools:** Atmel Studio, Git, GitHub

Project One:
AVR DC Motor Control Project

This project demonstrates RPM control of a DC motor using an ATMEGA328PB programmed with bare metal C++. RPM is regulated through pulse width modulation and encoder feedback. It showcases embedded systems programming and hardware interfacing.

Project Two:
This project interfaces the ATMEGA328PB with the BMI160 6-DOF IMU Gyroscope/Accelerometer to implement a real time orientation system. Using a complementary filter, it calculates roll, pitch, and yaw and displays the real time values on a serial plotter through UART and a OLED through I2C.
